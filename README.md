# Nemabiome_Final
Nemabiome validation study. 

After assigning taxonomy to the sequences the ASVs were merged based on species in the Merged column.Rmd file. They were then copied and pasted into the excel file (Nemabiome-refined), after that they were analysed through the Sequence_Depth.Rmd, Coverage.Rmd and Copy_number.Rmd.
